During the development of the 0.9 series, several features of Paste were extracted into smaller, more focused packages.
The testing suite became WebTest, the WSGI wrappers became WebOb, and the interactive debugging environment became WebError.
Pylons 0.9 follows these developments by switching from using Paste to the new packages which provide more functionality with little to no backwards incompatibility issues.


Pylons Merger with repoze.bfg and Birth of Pyramid Web Framework

Pyramid is an open source web framework written in Python and is based on WSGI. It is a minimalistic web framework inspired by Zope, Pylons and Django.

Pyramid Originally called "repoze.bfg".

In 2010 the Pylons framework will move over to using BFG as a base in version 1.5. As a result of the inclusion of BFG into the Pylons project, BFG was renamed Pyramid
