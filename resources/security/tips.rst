List of Secure Email Providers that take Privacy Serious
--------------------------------------------------------

http://freedomhacker.net/list-of-secure-email-providers-that-take-privacy-serious/


* ShazzleMail
    One of the most secure email providers.

    Canadian based company, really great and respects privacy. The leading provider in secure email. Get %25 off paid plans with code FREEDOMHACKER.

* StartMail.com

*  Lavabit
    Shut down as of August 2013 (the owner cannot state why, but many reliable sources say whistle blower Edward Snowden was using it, and the court made him shut the service down.)

*  SilentCircle.com
    Mail Shut down as of August 2013. All of their other services still work.

* TorGuard.net

* RiseUp.net
    Great secure offshore provider. Non profit and fights for digital freedoms.

* OpaqueMail.org

* Autistici/Inventati

* NeoMailBox.com

* 4SecureMail.com

* CryptoHeaven.com

* S-Mail.com

* Securenym.net

* Safe-Mail.net

* KeptPrivate.com

* Novo-Ordo.com

* LockBin.com

* AES.io

* SendINC.com
    Sends encrypted emails, not actually a provider, but allows full communication through your email but encrypting your email/emails.

* Opolis.eu

* OneShar.es – Self destructing emails

* BitMessage.ch

* MaskMe - Great service, its not a provider, not a throwaway email provider either. Read on their page what they are about. I would recommend using this everyday with Hushmail.

How to create your own root key and root certificate
----------------------------------------------------

https://jamielinux.com/articles/2013/08/act-as-your-own-certificate-authority/


Copy default ``/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf`` sample file  to your custom directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cp /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf ~/my_crt

Ensure that your OpenSSL configuration file (``~/my_crt/openssl.cnf``) specifies ``dir=~/my_crt``
within the ``[ CA_default ]`` section.

.. code-block:: bash

    [ CA_default ]

    dir = ~/my_crt

The very first cryptographic pair we generate includes what is known as a root certificate.

The root key (``ca.key.pem``) generated in this step should be kept extremely secure,

Otherwise an attacker can issue valid certificates for themselves.

We'll therefore protect it with ``AES 256-bit`` encryption and a strong password just in case it falls into the wrong hands:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ openssl genrsa -aes256 -out ca.key.pem 4096 -config ~/my_crt/openssl.cnf

    Enter pass phrase for ca.key.pem: secretpassword
    Verifying - Enter pass phrase for ca.key.pem: secretpassword

Open your OpenSSL configuration file (``~/my_crt/openssl.cnf``) and look for the ``[ usr_cert ]``
and ``[ v3_ca ]`` sections.

Make sure they contain the following options:

.. code-block:: bash

    [ usr_cert ]
    # These extensions are added when 'ca' signs a request.
    basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
    keyUsage = nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
    nsComment = "OpenSSL Generated Certificate"
    subjectKeyIdentifier=hash
    authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer

    [ v3_ca ]
    # Extensions for a typical CA
    subjectKeyIdentifier=hash
    authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid:always,issuer
    basicConstraints = CA:true
    keyUsage = cRLSign, keyCertSign

Now you can use the root key above to issue a root certificate (``ca.cert.pem``).

In this example, the certificate is set to expire in ten years. As this is a CA certificate,
use the ``v3_ca`` extension. You will be prompted for some responses, which you can fill with whatever you like.

For convenience, defaults can be set in the openssl configuration file.

The default digest is ``SHA-1``. ``SHA-1`` is considered insecure.
Pass the ``-sha256`` option to use a more secure digest.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key.pem \
        -sha256 -extensions v3_ca -out ca.cert.pem -config ~/my_crt/openssl.cnf

    Enter pass phrase for ca.key.pem:
    You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
    into your certificate request.
    -----
    Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:GB
    State or Province Name (full name) []:London
    Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:London
    Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:Alice CA
    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Certificate Authority
    Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:Alice CA
    Email Address []:alice@example.com

Armed with your root key (ca.key.pem) and root certificate (ca.cert.pem),
you are now ready to optionally create an intermediate certificate authority.


How to generate a certificate signing request (CSR)
---------------------------------------------------

https://gist.github.com/mtigas/952344

.. code-block:: bash

    $ openssl genrsa -aes256 -out client.key 4096 -config ~/my_crt/openssl.cnf
    $ openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr

    # self-signed
    $ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in client.csr -CA ca.cert.pem -CAkey ca.key.pem -set_serial 01 -out client.crt


Convert Client Key to PKCS
--------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ openssl pkcs12 -export -clcerts -in client.crt -inkey client.key -out client.p12


Mutual Authentication
---------------------

With ``des3``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 4096
    $ openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
    $ openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024
    $ openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
    $ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out server.crt
    $ openssl genrsa -des3 -out client.key 1024
    $ openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr
    $ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 02 -out client.crt
    $ openssl pkcs12 -export -clcerts -in client.crt -inkey client.key -out client.p12

With ``aes256`` and some more options:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ openssl genrsa -aes256 -out ca.key 4096 -config openssl.cnf
    $ openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -sha256 -extensions v3_ca -out ca.crt -config openssl.cnf
    $ openssl genrsa -aes256 -out server.key 4096 -config openssl.cnf
    $ openssl req -new -key server.key -sha256 -extensions v3_ca -out server.csr  -config openssl.cnf
    $ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out server.crt  -sha256 -extfile server_extKey.cnf
    $ openssl genrsa -aes256 -out client.key 4096 -config openssl.cnf
    $ openssl req -new -key client.key -sha256 -extensions v3_ca -out client.csr  -config openssl.cnf
    $ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 02 -out client.crt -sha256 -extfile client_extKey.cnf
    $ openssl pkcs12 -export -clcerts -in client.crt -inkey client.key -out client.p12

Note about common name:

Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:example.local

The Common Name option is the most important, as your domain used with the certificate needs to match it.

If you use the "www" subdomain, this means specifying the "www" subdomain as well!

Note about serial number:

This error ``(Error code: sec_error_reused_issuer_and_serial)`` occurred in firefox page with this description:

Your certificate contains the same serial number as another certificate issued by the certificate authority.

Please get a new certificate containing a unique serial number.

When serial number for client and CA is the same.
